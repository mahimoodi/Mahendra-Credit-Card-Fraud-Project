**Credit Card Fraud Detection**

**Problem Statement**

Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry. It is the unauthorized use of someone else’s credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash. It is crucial for credit card companies to recognize fraudulent transactions so that customers are not charged for items they did not purchase.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. These transactions occurred over two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions.

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. This model will help in identifying potential fraudulent transactions, thereby protecting customers from unauthorized charges and helping credit card companies minimize their losses.

**Methodology**

The methodology will involve preprocessing the data, handling the class imbalance issue, selecting appropriate features, and finally, building and evaluating the classification model. Various machine learning algorithms will be explored to find the one that provides the best performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Expected Outcome**

The expected outcome is a robust and reliable classification model that can accurately predict fraudulent transactions. This will significantly aid in the timely detection of fraud, thereby enhancing customer trust and satisfaction.

**Note**

Given the sensitive nature of the data, all necessary precautions will be taken to ensure data privacy and security. The data will be used solely for the purpose of this project and will not be shared or used for any other purposes.
